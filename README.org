* Introduction

  This ROS package contains a single, simple Python script that simply prints
  out the absolute path of the script itself. It also contains a very simple
  launch file that simply runs the Python script as a required node -- thus,
  when the node exits, the =roslaunch= process also dies. Both the launch file
  and the Python script are installed in the =CMakeLists.txt= file according to
  the official catkin documentation. See here for docs on [[http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/installing_other.html][installing arbitrary files]] and here for docs on [[http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/installing_python.html][installing Python scripts]].

  With this package we will illustrate the effects of using the =devel/= and the
  =install/= [[http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Development_.28Devel.29_Space][result spaces that catkin produces]]. Below we will provide some
  simple setup instructions, and then we will have a set of exercises that
  should help the reader understand the implications of using each of these
  spaces.

* Getting started

  We begin by creating a catkin workspace that we will use for all demos. We
  will assume the workspace is located at =~/demows= and that you are using ROS
  =melodic=. If that is not your situation, some of the commands below may
  require a bit of editing.

  Let's begin by initializing the workspace, and cloning this package into the
  =src/= directory:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # change directory to home:
  cd
  # create workspace directories:
  mkdir -p demows/src
  # initialize workspace and clone package:
  cd demows/src
  source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
  catkin_init_workspace
  git clone https://github.com/NU-MSR/demo_install_devel.git
  #+END_SRC

  Now we are ready to build the workspace which will create the =build/=
  directory, and by default, the =devel/= result space.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # change directory to the root of this workspace:
  cd ~/demows/
  # compile the whole workspace into the devel/ result space
  catkin_make
  # activate the devel/ result space
  source devel/setup.bash
  #+END_SRC

  Now we want to create the =install/= result space, but we need to make sure
  that we don't "extend" or "chain" the =devel/= space -- we want these two
  result spaces to be completely independent. When a result space is first
  created, the setup scripts (e.g. =setup.bash=) are automatically generated to
  have the /new/ result space extend whatever result spaces are already "active"
  in the current terminal. So we will explicitly set only the base ROS =melodic=
  installation as the active space before creating the =install/= result space:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # change directory to the root of this workspace:
  cd ~/demows/
  # activate only the "base" result space:
  source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
  # compile the whole workspace into the install/ result space
  catkin_make install
  # activate the install/ result space
  source install/setup.bash
  #+END_SRC

  Now we have both a =devel/= and an =install/= result space. To choose which
  one is currently active, all we have to do is "source" the =setup.bash= file
  from each respective space. To see this in action, see the snippet below where
  I source each setup file, and then print the relevant environment variables.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ alias rget='env |grep "ROS\|CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\|PYTHONPATH" |sort'
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ source install/setup.bash
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ rget > install_env.txt
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ source devel/setup.bash
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ rget > devel_env.txt
jarvis@test2018:~/demows⟫ diff install_env.txt devel_env.txt
  #+END_SRC

  The diff from the last line above is nicely formatted as:
  #+BEGIN_SRC diff
